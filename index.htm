<p>i'm blizzy <i>(she/her)</i>.</p>
<p>it feels like the only way i could escape the enshittification 
of the internet is if i tried to make a small place of my own.
i was inspired to do so by some other creative people and i hope 
more people go this route its fun. i never really got to enjoy 
the era of the internet i'm emulating with this project. but i 
hope maybe i can retake some of my creative free will. </p>
